Creating an interactive leaflet map

In this repository I store a R Quarto document that displays an interactive leaflet showing observations of Anthia decemguttata (a species of ground beetle that I am interested in for my honors project) and the study sites of my experiment as well as the code I used to generate the leaflet. 

The location data for observation points were pulled from iNaturalist, and the study site point were generated using GPS locations for the sites. 

The leaflet shows observations as red points and study sites as black points. The backgroup map also gives some indication of elevation, an important factor in my study.
